        <div> <h3> Who is Arsenals best player this season ? </h3>
        <p class="one" > This season arsenals best player is arguably Mesut Ozil, this is due to his amazing statistics , he has the highest assist tally in the premier league ahead of all the other premier league players by a significant amount.</p>
        
        <h3> Who is Arsenals worst player this season? </h3>
        <p class="two"> This season there are quite a few arsenal players who have not performed to the best of their ability, the names that appear in my head are flamini, chamberlain and mertasacker. This is due to the on going mistakes that have been made by the following players. Leading to several points being dropped.  </p>
        
        <h3> Who is Arsenals suprise star this season ? </h3>
        <p class="three"> Nacho Monreal has impressed several critics and fans due to his extremely consistent performances week in week out. A player who was once on the brink of leaving Arsenal for the chance of first team football is now arguably one of the top 3 left backs currently playing in the premier league. A player who honestly deserves a call up for the Spanish euro side.</p>
        
        <h3> Is it time for Arsene Wenger to go?</h3>
        <p>Arsene Wenger has had a very sucsessful spell as arsenal manager but many believe his time is running out due to his unsuccesful patch that saw arsenal not win a trohpy for 9 astonishing years. Although arsenal have won two FA cups in the past 2 years. This season was possibly their  best chance to win the premier league but they allowed their form to slip and are now currently chasing leiciester to win the premier league.</p>
